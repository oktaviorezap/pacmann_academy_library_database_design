# E-Library Database Design
<br>The design of the E-Library Database is essential for the smooth operation of the library system, ensuring that data is managed efficiently, 
<br>that resources are allocated correctly, and that users have a positive experience when interacting with the system. 
<br>With its emphasis on user limits, inventory management, and operational efficiency, the system supports the long-term sustainability 
<br>and growth of the library network while ensuring data integrity, security, and compliance with organizational policies.
